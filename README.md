# Student-Reg-Form-
Built a dynamic, single-page student registration form to efficiently capture personal, academic, course, parent, and additional details. Developed a Flask backend to process submissions and securely store all student data in a SQLite database, integrating frontend and backend for smooth, asynchronous, user-friendly operation for the user.
